Everything old is new again.
Out with the old, in with the new.
You canâ€™t teach an old dog new tricks.
Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue.
No old road leads to new destinations!
If you want something new, you have to stop doing something old.
It is unwise to pour new wine into old wineskins.
