# Travel Guide to Narnia*

Narnia is a magical land that lies beyond the wardrobe. It is a place where animals can talk, where winter lasts for a hundred years, and where a great lion named Aslan rules over all. Narnia is also a land of adventure, where brave heroes and heroines fight against the forces of evil. If you are looking for a destination that will enchant you with its beauty and thrill you with its dangers, then Narnia is the place for you. Here is a travel guide to help you plan your trip to this wonderful world.

## How to get there

The most common way to enter Narnia is through a wardrobe that belongs to an old professor who lives in a large house in the English countryside. The wardrobe is located in a spare room on the second floor, and it contains many fur coats and other clothes. If you push past the coats, you will find yourself in a snowy forest with a lamp-post nearby. This is the border between our world and Narnia.

However, there are other ways to reach Narnia as well. Sometimes, Aslan himself will call people from our world to help him with some important task. He can do this by sending magical rings, paintings, horns, or even trains that can transport people across the worlds. If you are lucky enough to be chosen by Aslan, you will know it when you see or hear something that reminds you of Narnia.

Another way to get to Narnia is by sailing on the Eastern Sea, which is connected to our world through a mysterious portal. The portal is located at the end of the world, where the water falls into a great chasm. Only a few brave explorers have ever ventured there, and they have reported seeing strange islands and creatures along the way. If you have a ship and a crew that are willing to follow you, you can try this route as well.

## What to see and do

Narnia has many attractions and activities for visitors of all ages and interests. Here are some of the most popular ones:

- Visit Cair Paravel, the royal castle of Narnia, where the four Pevensie children were crowned as kings and queens after defeating the White Witch. You can admire the architecture, the gardens, and the treasures of the castle, and maybe even meet some of the current rulers of Narnia.

- Explore the ruins of Charn, the ancient city of an evil empire that was destroyed by Queen Jadis, who later became the White Witch. You can see the statues of the former kings and queens of Charn, who were turned to stone by Jadis's magic word. You can also witness the awakening of Jadis by Digory Kirke, who accidentally brought her to our world.

- Ride on the back of a flying horse, or a winged lion, or any other creature that can fly in Narnia. You can soar above the mountains, the forests, and the rivers of Narnia, and enjoy the breathtaking views. You can also join in aerial battles against dragons, giants, or other enemies of Narnia.

- Travel to Archenland, the neighboring kingdom of Narnia, where humans and talking beasts live in harmony. You can visit Anvard, the capital city of Archenland, where King Lune and his son Prince Cor rule with wisdom and justice. You can also meet Shasta, a young boy who was raised by a fisherman but turned out to be Prince Cor's long-lost twin brother.

- Go on a quest to find Aslan's country, which is said to be beyond the Eastern Sea. You can join King Caspian and his crew on board the Dawn Treader, a magnificent ship that sails across the waters. You can encounter many wonders and dangers on your journey, such as islands of dreams, darkness, gold, dragons, mermaids, and more.

- Experience the last battle of Narnia, when Aslan returns to judge the living and the dead. You can witness the final confrontation between Aslan and his followers and Tash and his worshippers. You can also enter the stable door that leads to Aslan's country, which is revealed to be the true Narnia.

## What to eat and drink

Narnia has a variety of food and drink options for travelers. Here are some of the most delicious ones:

- Try Turkish delight, a sweet confection that is made of sugar, nuts, fruits, and spices. It is so addictive that Edmund Pevensie betrayed his siblings for it when he met the White Witch. However, be careful not to eat too much of it, as it can make you sick or even kill you.

- Enjoy roast mutton with potatoes and gravy, a hearty meal that is served at the Beaver's house. It is a traditional dish of Narnia, and it is especially good on cold winter nights. You can also have some tea and toast with honey and butter for dessert.

- Drink cordial, a refreshing beverage that is made of the juice of fire-flowers that grow in the sun. It is a gift from Father Christmas to Lucy Pevensie, and it has healing properties. It can cure any wound or illness, and even revive the dead. However, it should be used sparingly, as it is very potent and precious.

- Sample the fruits of the Western Wild, a land that lies beyond Narnia's western border. There you can find trees that bear apples, pears, plums, peaches, grapes, and other fruits that are sweeter and juicier than any you have ever tasted. You can also drink the water of the river that flows from the garden of Aslan, which is clear and cold and makes you feel alive.

## What to avoid

Narnia is not without its dangers and pitfalls. Here are some of the things you should avoid when visiting Narnia:

- Do not trust anyone who offers you magic or promises you power or wealth in exchange for something. They are most likely agents of evil, who want to deceive you and use you for their own purposes. They may even be the White Witch or her allies in disguise.

- Do not wander into the woods alone or at night. You may encounter wild animals, bandits, or worse. You may also get lost or fall into traps. Always stay with your companions or guides, and follow their advice.

- Do not disrespect Aslan or his laws. He is the true king and lord of Narnia, and he deserves your reverence and obedience. He is also very powerful and wise, and he knows what is best for you and Narnia. If you disobey him or harm his creation, you will face his wrath or his justice.

- Do not lose hope or faith in Aslan. He may seem to be absent or silent at times, but he is always watching over you and Narnia. He may also test you or challenge you to grow in courage and wisdom. He will always come to your aid when you need him most, and he will never abandon you or Narnia.

## Conclusion

Narnia is a land of wonder and adventure, where anything can happen. It is also a land of mystery and meaning, where everything has a purpose. It is a land where Aslan reigns supreme, and where his love and grace are shown to all who seek him.
